ðŸš€Happy to Share my Ecommerce Sales Analysis Dashboard. ðŸš€
Objective: To enhance business performance by leveraging data-driven insights.
Key Tasks:
â€¢ Dashboard Development: I created a user-friendly dashboard that visually highlights key sales metrics. The dashboard includes interactive features for easy exploration of data.
â€¢ Data Analysis: I analysed past sales data to identify trends, patterns, and unusual events. This helped me understand how well our sales strategies are working.
â€¢ Sales Forecasting: I used data analysis to predict future sales for the next 20 days. This information can help us plan and allocate resources effectively.
â€¢ Actionable Insights: I turned my data findings into practical suggestions to improve our business. These recommendations can guide strategic decision-making.
Project Overview: ðŸ“Š
â€¢ Dataset: Sales, Product, and Store data for 2017-2019.
â€¢ Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, null values, and corrected data types.
â€¢ Data Modelling: Established relationships between Sales, Product, and Store tables.
â€¢ Dashboard Creation: Developed an interactive dashboard to analyse revenue patterns.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Sales, Ship Days
 DAX Measures: I utilized DAX functions to create calculations for average shipping days, year-over-year sales performance, and monthly sales trends. I also developed DAX-based tables to summarize total sales by order date.
Visualizations & Charts: ðŸ“Š Total Revenue by Category, Percentage of Orders by State, Percentage of Revenue Share by Brand, Revenue Growth by Month
Dashboard Features:
â€¢ Slicer: Allows users to filter data by year (2017, 2018, 2019).
â€¢ Filter Pane: Provides additional filtering options for detailed analysis.
â€¢ Interactive Elements: Enables users to explore data through drill-through and other interactive features.
This project was a great opportunity to showcase the power of DAX and Power BI in delivering actionable insights from complex data.
